# CoDASH 

Ghent's heritage institutions and museums are preserving an enormous amount of cultural heritage. At the same time the citizens of Ghent possess a treasure trove of knowledge and stories.

For Collections of Ghent, the City and its museums and archives are collaborating with partners from the corporate, cultural, and academic world to digitize an invaluable collection of more-or-less 100,000 objects, stories and documents. This collected heritage will converge in CoGent, an immersive, high-tech and mobile experience room. The CoGent box will go on tour in three neighbourhoods of Ghent: Watersportbaan - Ekkergem, Tolhuis-Sluizeken-Ham and Wondelgem.  Visitors will be able to participate by adding personal stories about the cultural heritage displayed in the CoGent box.

The Collections of Ghent will be an intersection where heritage, research, and technology will meet. 

CoDASH offers an insigth in the collected data via an interactive dashboard.
